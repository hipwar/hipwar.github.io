algorithmic decision making in the absence of intuitive initiation

make decisions based solely on data, and use intuition to sniff out problems in model design

Thomas Davenport's "look out the window" will help to see data that the model will miss

"Because we humans are so fond of our judgment, and so overconfident in it, many of us, if not most, will be too quick to override the comptuers, even when their answer is better." p.55

keep score whenever possible: evaluate the effectiveness of decisions made by people and machines

let judgment serve as an input to the model

we unconsciously shift from assessment to hunting for evidence that confirms our biases

learn how to do this with job interviews

Our decisions can be improved simply: take judgment as an input, and let there be an override.

Better yet, take the judgments of a thousand people.
