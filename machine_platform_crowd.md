algorithmic decision making in the absence of intuitive initiation

make decisions based solely on data, and use intuition to sniff out problems in model design

Thomas Davenport's "look out the window" will help to see data that the model will miss

"Because we humans are so fond of our judgment, and so overconfident in it, many of us, if not most, will be too quick to override the comptuers, even when their answer is better." p.55

keep score whenever possible: evaluate the effectiveness of decisions made by people and machines

let judgment serve as an input to the model

we unconsciously shift from assessment to hunting for evidence that confirms our biases

learn how to do this with job interviews

Our decisions can be improved simply: take judgment as an input, and let there be an override.

Better yet, take the judgments of a thousand people.

Interesting questions on page 109:

If you have business processes that require a lot of person-to-person interaction, is this because your customers (or employees, suppliers, or other partners) value it, or because they don't have an equally efficient digital alternative?
which aspects of work in your industry are most likely to be virtualized in the next three to five years? If given the choice, which of your customers would prefer more virtualized interactions?

I should define virtualization in this context.

The robotic cambrian explosion is due to cheap sensors and digital progress of all kinds. DANCE: Data, Algorithms, Networks, Cloud, Exponential improvements in hardware.

Drive Hard, Design Weird.

Design Weird -- I like that.

How long until we apply the process of systematic improvement using data to education? Learning optimization processes, do they exist as yet? 
Knowledge acquisition, memory recall, habit formation, holistic integration. Let's get it.
