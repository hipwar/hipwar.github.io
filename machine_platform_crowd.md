Part 1: Mind and Machine

Algorithmic decision making in the absence of intuitive initiation outperforms the expert+machine paradigm.

We should begin to make decisions based solely on data, and use intuition to sniff out problems in model design.

Thomas Davenport's "look out the window" will help to see data that the model will miss. So we let the data continue our forward motion, and use our energies elsewhere to avoid obvious mistakes.

"Because we humans are so fond of our judgment, and so overconfident in it, many of us, if not most, will be too quick to override the comptuers, even when their answer is better." p.55

Make sure to keep score whenever possible: evaluate the effectiveness of decisions made by people and machines. Pit those scores against each other. Use data to make better decisions across the board.

Let expert judgment serve as an input to predictive models.

In hiring, we should rely on data more. Studies show that in job interviews, our questions have us unconsciously shift from assessment of the candidate's ability to hunting for evidence that confirms our biases about the candidate.

Our decisions can be improved simply: take judgment as an input, and let there be an override.

Better yet, take the judgments of a thousand people.

Interesting questions on page 109:

If you have business processes that require a lot of person-to-person interaction, is this because your customers (or employees, suppliers, or other partners) value it, or because they don't have an equally efficient digital alternative?
which aspects of work in your industry are most likely to be virtualized in the next three to five years? If given the choice, which of your customers would prefer more virtualized interactions?

The obvious one that comes to mind is the help/checkout desk. 90% of that could be virtualized and automated, saving vast resources on staffing.

I should define virtualization in this context.

The robotic cambrian explosion is due to cheap sensors and digital progress of all kinds. DANCE: Data, Algorithms, Networks, Cloud, Exponential improvements in hardware.

Drive Hard, Design Weird.

Design Weird -- I like that.

How long until we apply the process of systematic improvement using data to education? Learning optimization processes, do they exist as yet? 
Knowledge acquisition, memory recall, habit formation, holistic integration. Let's get it.

From: p. 125:
Digital tech doe a poor job of satisfying social drives, so we should focus on creating quality experiences around empathy, leadership, teamwork, and coaching.
As technology advances, high-level social skills could become even more valuable than advanced quantitative ones. And the ability to combine social with quantitative skills will often have the highest payoff of all.

Machines now generate music, paintings, photographs, dialog, scientific advances, industrial designs, etc. But they only provide the starting points of a particular idea.
I might not be able to generate music of a particular genre, but when I play piano, I am voicing a song that has played in my head for years. I use the medium to explore an idea.
Human devices are mediums for exploration of ideas, in addition to being "for making some output"? So a piano is not only a musical instrument, but also a form of communication.

Part 2: Product and Platform

Platforms will replace the existing mechanism for distribution of information. The internet is the obvious example. Information flows freely, instantaneously, and perfectly. The death of distance, as claimed by Francis Cairncross (p. 137).
So what is left? Well, plenty. Connection to a local community and place. Creation and transfer of new knowledge. Research centers will be important. Voices in the conversation will need to be heard.
But how one finds their opportunity to engage in the discussion is still an open question. For one can study on many platforms to get up to speed about a subject, but how do they enter the conversation?
Need to think deeply about the supply and demand economics of our product. My focus is so encapsulated in the operations I'm involved in. How to branch out?

Turn difficult behaviors into default behaviors. Example:
	Printing slip pocket on the machine	
	Slips have form that makes certain steps clear
	Material temperatures
	Slicing program (cura, slic3r)
	Model: STL/OBJ watertight? minimum features?
	Layers checked for accuracy
	Estimated print time & weight
They can almost all be checkboxes.
