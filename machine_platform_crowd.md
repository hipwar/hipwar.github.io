Algorithmic decision making in the absence of intuitive initiation outperforms the expert+machine paradigm.

We should begin to make decisions based solely on data, and use intuition to sniff out problems in model design.

Thomas Davenport's "look out the window" will help to see data that the model will miss. So we let the data continue our forward motion, and use our energies elsewhere to avoid obvious mistakes.

"Because we humans are so fond of our judgment, and so overconfident in it, many of us, if not most, will be too quick to override the comptuers, even when their answer is better." p.55

Make sure to keep score whenever possible: evaluate the effectiveness of decisions made by people and machines. Pit those scores against each other. Use data to make better decisions across the board.

Let expert judgment serve as an input to predictive models.

In hiring, we should rely on data more. Studies show that in job interviews, our questions have us unconsciously shift from assessment of the candidate's ability to hunting for evidence that confirms our biases about the candidate.

Our decisions can be improved simply: take judgment as an input, and let there be an override.

Better yet, take the judgments of a thousand people.
