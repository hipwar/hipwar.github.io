# Notes on my reading of Whiplash

## Emergence over Authority


## Pull over Push
Create opportunities for connections rather than creating specific outcomes. A group of learners isn't all going to arrive at the same destination, so why not instead of teaching destinations, teach skills for getting places?

## Compasses over Maps
Again with the ways of getting places. We have to abandon the notion that we can keep our heads around a set of knowledge that users will find helpful. Instead, we can learn learning, and do it constantly.

Learning to code is an efficient way to learn how to learn. "Learning to code helps you organize, express, and share your ideas -- just like learning to write. Coding to learn. Story of the Scratch Foundation. p106.

## Risk over Safety


## Disobediennce over Compliance
In order to maximize creative output of each person in the [Media] Lab, people often have to be deprogrammed from needing to know what the "right" answer is, what is being asked of them, what they need to comply with in order to "pass". Sure, there are guidelines, and as part of a large institution, there are some rules that people must follow. The point is that these rules are not the focus. It's the freedom to act without asking permission... At the Media Lab, the favorite opener to any story is, "It turns out that...," which basically means, "We were wrong in this cool way." p151.

Old approaches: Metrics are important for measuring your progress when you know exactly what you want to do, but they can also stifle innovation. Organizations that rely on grants for much of their funding may become tethered to incrementalism. If teach of their grant proposals describes not only the research they intend to carry out but also how it will be measured, they won't be able to explore unexpected paths or pursue an interesting wrong turn. p161.

## Practice over Theory


## Diversity over Ability


## Resilience over Strength

Resilience doesn't mean anticipating failure; it means anticipating that you can't anticipate what's next, and working instead on a sort of situational awareness. ... Chart a new strategy predicated less on winning and power than on thriving in an unpredictable world. p213.

## Systems over Objects

Recognize that responsible innovation requires more than speed and efficiency. It also requires a constant focus on the overall impact of new technologies, and an understanding of the connections between people, their communities, and their environments. p23X??.

## Conclusion

Deeply concerned about the ability of large institutions to weather a crucial juncture in human history, which is to say, our own historical moment, a worry exacerbated by a shared belief that the future holds far more radical, tumultuous change than the average executive understood. p247.

What's next? You don't know? Guess what. Neither does anyone else. No one can predict the future. In fact, experts and so-called futurists have some of the worst records of all -- underperforming that perennial contender, Random Guess. <p> And that's good, because maintaining a ahealthy relationship with uncertainty is one of the big themes that run through the principles. Mankind has been hubmled during the last few years, but that's nothing compared to what's headed our way. SUccessful oranizations will not, for instance, bet the house on quartlerly sales predictions, knowing that a black swan could be just over the next pass. ... We are only now discovering just how little we know. p249.
