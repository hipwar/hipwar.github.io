# Notes on my reading of Whiplash

## Emergence over Authority


## Pull over Push
Create opportunities for connections rather than creating specific outcomes. A group of learners isn't all going to arrive at the same destination, so why not instead of teaching destinations, teach skills for getting places?

## Compasses over Maps
Again with the ways of getting places. We have to abandon the notion that we can keep our heads around a set of knowledge that users will find helpful. Instead, we can learn learning, and do it constantly.

## Risk over Safety


## Disobediennce over Compliance


## Practice over Theory


## Diversity over Ability


## Resilience over Strength


## Systems over Objects


## Conclusion
